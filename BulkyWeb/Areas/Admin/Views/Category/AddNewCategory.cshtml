<!--The first queation to ask yourself is what is the model
    Here, our model will be the category itself 
    

    If nothing is passed in the view (in the controller) and if we are defining a category, it will create a new object for that and by default, all the values will be empty and that is what we want 
    Bascally, even if you do not pass anything in the view and you have a model category, it will think of it as a new category object with the default values 

-->

<!--Since this partial view only has scripts, we will have to add that in a new section that is only for scripts-->

        <partial name="_ValidationScriptsPartial" />
        //Thus, we have added the parial view in the scripts section of the View page
    }
}<!--because this partial view was sript-related, we added it to the Scripts section. But if it was not scripts related, we could have added it directly to the html. ->
<!--By default, it will go and look in the shared folder because that is the default location for any partial view. Because of that, it will automatically find that and it will add the JavaScript that is needed for
client side validation. Now the validation will be done first on the client’s side and for custom validation, it will go to the server side. This means that for error messages that we have in our data annotations, those appear before we can even press create-->
